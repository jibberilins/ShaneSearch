					 <h2>Bye bye Sony laptops</h2>
                          <p>Sony is to cut 5,000 jobs and stop making PC products.
								The Japanese electronics firm said as part of its restructuring plans it would reduce its overheads by £600m a year.
								Approached by Sky News, Sony UK declined to say what impact this would on its British workforce.
								It said "drastic changes" in the computer market meant it would now focus on smartphones and tablets and "cease planning, design and development of PC products".
								Large losses in the television sector have previously thwarted the company's ability to compete with smartphone manufacturers Apple and Samsung.
								Sony now expects a full-year loss of £660m in the fiscal year ending in March.</p>
